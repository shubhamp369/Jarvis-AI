 The Desktop Assistant project aims to build an intelligent and interactive desktop application that serves as a virtual assistant for users. It performs a variety of tasks such as managing files, browsing the web, sending emails, setting reminders, providing weather updates, answering questions, and more, based on user input. The assistant will use natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to understand and respond to user requests.

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries such as PyAutoGUI for automation, Pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, SpeechRecognition for voice recognition), JavaScript, C# (for desktop app development).

Speech Recognition: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, CMU Sphinx, or Wit.ai.

Text-to-Speech: pyttsx3, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).

APIs: For weather (OpenWeather API), news (NewsAPI), email (SMTP for sending emails).
